// 4 to add text to a document.Format: 4 [location] [seq] e.g. 4 0 abcd will append abcd to the end of the document
//                                                             at location 0

// As another example, command 4 (to add text to a document) expect us to first
// give an integer between 0 and MAX-1 to indicate which document from the array we

// it will add to the document
